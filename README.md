# Cloud-Computing-Project

The project includes development of a tourism application for Canada. The application allows users to search for tourist destinations like major cities and highlight the key features such as museums, art gallery, beaches, and parks. To book a ticket, the user is required to have an account and should log in into the application first. Once the payment is done, the application will generate a ticket mentioning all the details of the trip. The key requirements of the application are security, efficiency, accuracy and responsiveness. The application is secured using AWS CloudFront and lightweight since all the back-end processing is done on cloud. It is accessible through computers and mobile devices via a website and a thin client mobile app where all the computations are performed on cloud. The cloud server is made of several EC2 instances, load balancer, active listeners, etc., to make the application more efficient.

1. Mobile Application (Android) code is present in the folder named "mobile"
2. Fron-end web application code which was developed in React JS is present in folder named "front_end"
3. For backend server functionality, different API's were developed for all the modules and the code is present in "back_end/Docker" folder.
