# Cloud-Computing-Project

The project requires to develop a tourism application for Canada. The application should allow users to search for tourist destinations like major cities and highlight the key features such as museums, art gallery, beaches, and parks. To book a ticket, the user is required to have an account and should log in into the application first. Once the payment is done, the application will generate a ticket mentioning all the details of the trip. The key requirements of the application are security, efficiency, accuracy and responsiveness. The application needs to be secured and lightweight. It should be accessible through computers and mobile devices via a website and a thin client mobile app where all the computation will be performed on cloud. The cloud server should be made of several instances, load balancer, active listeners, etc., to make the application more efficient.

1. Mobile Application (Android) code is present in the folder named "mobile"
2. Fron-end web application code which was developed in React JS is present in folder named "front_end"
3. For backend server functionality, different API's were developed for all the modules and the code is present in "back_end/Docker" folder.
